== Introduction ==
* The Linux Tools project is a two-faceted project
# Firstly, it provides tools and frameworks for writing tools relevant to Linux developers.
# Secondly, it provides a place for Linux distributions to collaboratively overcome issues surrounding distribution packaging of Eclipse technology. The project produces both best practices and tools related to packaging.
